# PhDs App

You can access the data visualization [here](https://lyndalin.shinyapps.io/phds-app/).

In this data visualization, I use R and Shiny to explore the postgraduate pathways that doctorates pursue, their median salaries in the workforce, as well as patterns in the number of doctorate degrees received across the years.

The data were obtained from the [Survey of Earned Doctorates](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/).
